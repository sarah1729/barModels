Next steps with bar models:
- 2 of the 3 pieces of a percent problem, randomly chosen
- levels: 
    1: halves, quarters
    2: three-quarters
- draggable bar model to help make an estimate (0 at the left, place where you enter a number where the color ends, place where you add a number at the end of the rectangle)
- drag part and whole until they are in the right relationship
- double number line/bar model (one on top and one on the bottom)
- once you have them the way you like them, make an estimate
    Level 1: find the number
- Feedback: 
    How close are you to the number?
    Bar model corrects itself to show the right percent, part, etc.

Learning objectives:
- After activity, think visually about context
- Translate context into part/whole visual representation
- Have an idea of what's reasonable
- Practice estimating
- Use bar models to calculate percents

- build idea of percents as pieces
